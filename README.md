# golden-doodles

### Intro
This is our fall 2019 CS171 final project.

### Files
#### CSS files
All CSS files are in the css folder. The style.css file is written by us, 
and the remaining files are from libraries.
#### Javascript files
Javascript files are located in the js folder. Libraries are in the assets folder.
All .js files in the js folder were written by us.
#### Data
Data was acquired from the Global Nutrition report 
[website](https://globalnutritionreport.org/reports/global-nutrition-report-2018/dataset-and-metadata/).
and cleaned. Various cross sections and derivatives of the data were saved in the data folder.
#### Images
All images are from Google Image search and the source websites are listed
 in the references section of the website.
 #### node\_modules
External libraries that require multiple files are in the node\_modules folder.
#### HTML
We wrote index.html.
#### Other
We include the following standard files for Github repositories:
 - .gitignore: an automated file for git version control.
 - LICENSE: we use the GPL-3.0 license to open source our code.
 - README.md: this file, which is, of course, written by us.
 
### Interface Features
We hope that all features are sufficiently clear, but just in case, we provide 
here an overview of the main features in our website.
